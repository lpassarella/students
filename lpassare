I am Linsey Passarella

I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics and Meteorology at the College of Charleston. I am currently a first year student in the Data Science and Engineering program here at UTK. I work at ORNL in the Computation Earth Sciences group evaluating the efficiency of the DOE's new high-resolution climate model. I am excited to apply what I learn in this class to my research.
